# Copilot Core Architecture Proposal

This repository presents a unified architecture for embedding Copilot across Microsoft 365, GitHub, Windows, and Security Copilot. The goal is to evolve Copilot from a passive assistant into a proactive, session-aware orchestrator that enhances both productivity and security.

## 🔧 Key Concepts

- **Session-based orchestration**: Maintain context and continuity across Word, Excel, PowerPoint, VS Code, Windows, and security tools.
- **Security Copilot integration**: Real-time threat detection and adaptive response via Microsoft Defender.
- **Feedback-driven intelligence**: Learn from user activity, productivity context, and past security incidents.
- **Proactive coordination**: Copilot acts as a system-level conductor, not just an app-level assistant.
