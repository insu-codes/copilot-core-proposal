🧭 Copilot Core Architecture Proposal

This repository presents a unified architecture for embedding Copilot across Microsoft 365, GitHub, Windows, and Security Copilot. The goal is to evolve Copilot from a passive assistant into a proactive, session-aware orchestrator that enhances both productivity and security.

---

🔧 Key Concepts

- Session-based orchestration  
  Maintain context and continuity across Word, Excel, PowerPoint, VS Code, Windows, and security tools.

- Security Copilot integration  
  Enable real-time threat detection and adaptive response through Microsoft Defender and Security Copilot.

- Feedback-driven intelligence  
  Learn from user activity, productivity context, and past security incidents to improve future performance.

- Proactive coordination  
  Copilot acts as a system-level conductor, orchestrating tools and agents across the stack—not just assisting within individual apps.
